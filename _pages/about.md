## Biography
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Data Science and Information Technology from the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Professor [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics ([Yangming Innovation Class](http://ymxy.nbu.edu.cn/ymcxb1.htm)) from the [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/) in 2018, advised by Professor [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). 


I was a research intern at Ant Security Lab (2021), working with Dr. Weifeng Qiu and Dr. [Feng Xue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B3%B0-%E8%96%9B-7817005a); a research intern at Tencent AI Lab (2020, 2019), working with Dr. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/) and Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (supported by the Tencent Rhino-bird Elite Training Program).  


My research mainly focuses on AI security, especially backdoor learning, adversarial learning, and data privacy. My research is supported by the Tsinghua 'Future Scholar' Ph.D. Fellowship.
