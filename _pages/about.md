## Biography
I received my Ph.D. degree with honors in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Professor [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I received my B.S. degree with honors in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/) in 2018, advised by Professor [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). 

**My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy ML**, especially backdoor attacks and defenses, data privacy, and copyright protection in deep learning. My long-term goal is to **make DL-based algorithms more robust and secure during their full life-cycle**. Recently, I focus more on **Trustworthy Large Foundation Models** (*e.g.*, GPT-4). I always **chase for simple yet effective methods** with deep insights and theoretical supports. 


## Annocement
I am always looking for highly self-motivated students and interns to join exciting research projects on Trustworthy AI in our group. Drop me an email if you are interested.
