## Biography
I am currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. [Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) and Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). Before that, I was a Research Professor (ZJU Qizhen Outstanding Young Scholar, HIC-ZJU-100 Young Professor) in the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security at Zhejiang University and also in HIC-ZJU, working with Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Kui Ren](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my Ph.D. degree with honors in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). I received my B.S. degree with honors in Mathematics from Ningbo University (Yangming Class), advised by Prof. [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). I also collaborated closely with Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (from Tencent) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8vJkTcAAAAJ&hl=en) (from UIUC) during my Ph.D. journey.

**My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy ML and Responsible AI**, especially security assessment & improvement and copyright protection in deep learning. My long-term goal is to **make AI-based methods more secure and copyright-preserving during their full life cycle**. Recently, I focus more on **Trustworthy Generative AI** (*e.g.*, LLMs and Diffusion Models). I always **chase for simple yet effective methods** with deep insights and theoretical support. 

My research has been published in multiple top-tier conferences  and journals, such as ICLR, NeurIPS, and IEEE TIFS. I served as the Area Chair of ACM MM, the Senior Program Committee Member of AAAI, and the Reviewer of IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TDSC, etc. My research has been featured by major media outlets, such as IEEE Spectrum. I was the recipient of the Best Paper Award at PAKDD (2023), the Rising Star Award at WAIC (2023), the KAUST Rising Stars in AI (2024), and the DAAD AInet Fellowship (2024).


## Annocement
I am **always looking for highly self-motivated students and research interns** to join exciting research projects on Trustworthy ML and Responsible AI in our group at Zhejiang University. I will provide responsible and hands-on guidance. Besides, I am **always willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators**. Drop me an email if you are interested!
