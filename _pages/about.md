## Biography
I am currently a ~~second~~ third year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, China. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Ningbo University, China, in 2018. **My research mainly focus on the security of machine learning**, including *inference security* (mainly on adversarial learning and robust machine learning), *training security* (mainly on backdoor learning), and *data security* (mainly on data privacy).

## Education
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Aug. 2018 - Present
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm) and Prof. [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm)

* Exchange Student, University of Wisconsin, Jan. 2017 − May. 2017

* B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Yangming Innovation Class, Ningbo University, Aug. 2014 - May. 2018
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm)
  * Thesis Topic: Study and Application of Ensemble Learning in Deep Learning (Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis in Ningbo University)


## News
* 11/2020: One paper is acceptted by NeurIPS Workshop 2020. Its code will be released on Github soon.
* 10/2020: I finished my internship at Tencent AI Lab, working on "Secure ML". 465 days, a memorable journey.
* 09/2020: Our technical report, The ATT&CK Matrix of AI Security, is released (in Chinese). [[Link]](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/media/AI%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%A8%81%E8%83%81%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9%E7%9F%A9%E9%98%B5.pdf) [[News]](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2020-09-25-9). It is the first technical report comprehensively covering different kinds of security threats in the full cycle of an AI system. It could be an important reference for AI researchers, AI engineers, and AI users.
* 07/2020: One paper is accepted by ECCV 2020 and its code is also released in Github.
