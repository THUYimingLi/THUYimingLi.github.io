## Biography
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Data Science and Information Technology from the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Professor [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics ([Yangming Innovation Class](http://ymxy.nbu.edu.cn/ymcxb1.htm)) from the [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/) in 2018, advised by Professor [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm).


I was a research intern at Ant Security Lab (2021), working with Dr. Weifeng Qiu and Dr. [Feng Xue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B3%B0-%E8%96%9B-7817005a); a research intern at Tencent AI Lab (2020, 2019), working with Dr. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/) and Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (supported by the Tencent Rhino-bird Elite Training Program).  


My research mainly focuses on AI security, especially backdoor learning, adversarial learning, and data privacy. My research is supported by the Tsinghua 'Future Scholar' Ph.D. Fellowship, and my Ph.D. dissertation topic is 'Research on Poisoning-based Backdoor Attacks in Computer Vision'.
