## Biography
I am currently a third year Ph.D. candidate from the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI), Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS) at Tsinghua University, China. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Ningbo University, China, in 2018. **My research mainly focus on the AI security**, including 
  * Model Security of the Training Process (mainly on the Backdoor Learning)
  * Model Security of the Inference Process (mainly on the Adversarial Learning and Robust Machine Learning)
  * Data Privacy
