## Biography
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Professor [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I received my B.S. degree with honor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/) ([Yangming Innovation Class](http://ymxy.nbu.edu.cn/ymcxb1.htm)) in 2018, advised by Professor [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). **Currently, my research mainly focuses on AI security**, especially backdoor learning, adversarial learning, and data privacy. My research is supported by the Tsinghua 'Future Scholar' Ph.D. Fellowship, and my Ph.D. dissertation topic is 'Poisoning-based Backdoor Attacks in Computer Vision'.


I was a research intern at Ant CyberSecurity Group (2021, 2022), working with Dr. Feng Xue and Dr. [Tao Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao3wEckAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao); a research intern at Tencent AI Lab (2020, 2019), working with Dr. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/) and Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (supported by the Tencent Rhino-bird Elite Training Program); an intern at Wukong Investment Management Company (2018), working on ML-based high-frequency trading.  



**I will graduate in June 2023 (expected). Currently, I am looking for both academic and industrial job opportunities (especially post-doc positions regarding AI security) starting from Summer 2023. Feel free to connect if there are suitable opportunities!**
