## Biography
I am currently a Research Professor at Zhejiang University (also affiliated with ZJU-HIC), working closely with Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Kui Ren](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree with honors in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). I received my B.S. degree with honors in Mathematics from [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). I also collaborated closely with Prof. [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8vJkTcAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) during my Ph.D. journey.

**My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy ML**, especially backdoor attacks/defenses and copyright protection in deep learning. My long-term goal is to **make DNNs more secure and copyright-preserving during their full life cycle**. Recently, I focus more on **Trustworthy Large Foundation Models** (*e.g.*, GPT and Diffusion Model). I always **chase for simple yet effective methods** with deep insights and theoretical support. 


## Annocement
I am **always looking for highly self-motivated students and research interns** to join exciting research projects on Trustworthy AI in our group. Besides, I am **always willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators**. Drop me an email if you are interested!
