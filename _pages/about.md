## Biography
I am currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. [Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) and Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). Before that, I was a Research Professor (HIC-ZJU-100 Young Professor, ZJU Qizhen Outstanding Young Scholar) in the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security at Zhejiang University and also in HIC-ZJU, working closely with Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Kui Ren](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my Ph.D. degree with honors in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). I received my B.S. degree with honors in Mathematics from Ningbo University (Yangming Class), advised by Prof. [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). I also collaborated closely with Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (from Tencent) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8vJkTcAAAAJ&hl=en) (from UIUC) during my Ph.D. journey.

**My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy ML and Responsible AI**, especially backdoor attacks/defenses and copyright protection in deep learning. My long-term goal is to **make DNNs more secure and copyright-preserving during their full life cycle**. Recently, I focus more on **Trustworthy Large Foundation Models** (*e.g.*, GPT and Diffusion Model). I always **chase for simple yet effective methods** with deep insights and theoretical support. 


## Annocement
I am **always looking for highly self-motivated students and research interns** to join exciting research projects on Trustworthy ML and Responsible AI in our group. I will provide responsible and hands on guidance. Besides, I am **always willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators**. Drop me an email if you are interested!
