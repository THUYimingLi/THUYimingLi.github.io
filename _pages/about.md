## Biography
I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Professor [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Professor [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). Before that, I received my B.S. degree with honor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Ningbo University](https://www.nbu.edu.cn/en/) ([Yangming Innovation Class](http://ymxy.nbu.edu.cn/ymcxb1.htm)) in 2018, advised by Professor [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm).


At the beginning of my Ph.D. journey, I studied tree-based methods for their interpretability and good theoretical properties. **Currently, my research mainly focuses on AI security**, especially backdoor learning, adversarial learning, data privacy, and copyright protection in deep learning. I always chase for simple yet effective methods with deep insights or even theoretical supports. My research is supported by the Tsinghua 'Future Scholar' Ph.D. Fellowship.


Currently, I am working with Professor [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) at UIUC as a visiting Ph.D. student. I was a research intern at Ant Security Lab (2021, 2022), working with Dr. [Haiqin Weng](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Haiqin-Weng/33167731) and Dr. [Tao Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao3wEckAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao); a research intern at Tencent AI Lab (2019, 2020), working with Dr. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/) and Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (supported by the Tencent Rhino-bird Elite Training Program); an intern at Wukong Investment (2018), working with Dr. [Xinji Liu](https://www.wukongtz.com/pages_8/) on ML-based high-frequency trading.  


**I am always willing to work together on interesting projects**. Feel free to drop me an email if you have any ideas or suitable opportunities to discuss!
