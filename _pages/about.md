## Biography
I am currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. [Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) and Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I was a Research Professor (similar to a Tenure-track Associate Professor in the U.S.) in the group led by Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ) and Prof. [Kui Ren](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ&hl=en), the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security at Zhejiang University and also in HIC-ZJU. I received my Ph.D. degree with honors in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yong Jiang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jy/main.htm) and Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst/main.htm). I received my B.S. degree with honors in Mathematics from Ningbo University (Yangming Class), advised by Prof. [Lifeng Xi](http://math.nbu.edu.cn/info/1046/1098.htm). I also collaborated closely with Dr. [Zhifeng Li](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VTrRNN4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (from Tencent) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8vJkTcAAAAJ&hl=en) (from UIUC) during my Ph.D. journey.

**My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy ML and Responsible AI**, especially AI Security & Safety and AI Copyright Protection. My long-term goal is to **make AI-based systems more secure and copyright-preserving during their full life cycle**. Recently, I focus more on **Trustworthy Generative AI** (*e.g.*, LLMs and Diffusion Models). I always **chase for simple yet effective methods** with deep insights and theoretical support. 

My research has been published in leading venues, such as IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, IEEE TPAMI, and IEEE TIFS. My research has been featured in major media outlets, including IEEE Spectrum and MIT Technology Review. I serves as an Associate Editor of Pattern Recognition, Area Chair for ICML, NeurIPS, and ACM Multimedia, and Senior Program Committee Member for AAAI and IJCAI. I also regularly reviews for leading journals such as IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, IEEE TIFS, and IEEE TDSC. I am the recipient of several prestigious honors, such as the Best Paper Award at PAKDD, the Rising Star Award at WAIC, the KAUST Rising Stars in AI, and the DAAD AInet Fellowship.
